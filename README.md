# Create MVC Template
Creates a blank NodeJS MVC-based file template, with included configuration files. This is a personal project, and configurations / file structures are purely based on personal preference.

### How the app works:
1. User input to detect which configuration files to include.
2. Read files from application memory
3. Paste file contents in new files (maybe with powershell commands)
4. Create file model

### Add-ons:
- Init Git repository
- Init NPM
