# Create MVC Template
Creates a blank NodeJS MVC-based file template, with included configuration files. This is a personal project, and configurations / file structures are purely based on personal preference.

### How the app works:
1. User input to detect which configuration files to include.
2. Read files from application memory
3. Paste file contents in new files (maybe with powershell commands)
4. Create file model

### To-Do:
- [x] Map *prompts* response to usable array
- [ ] Copying files to location --> Write file or copy?
### Add-ons:

- TailwindCSS config file
- Snowpack config file
- Nodemon config file
- Prettier config file
- ESLint config file
- Add `.gitattributes` file
- Add `.gitignore` file
- Add `README.md` file
- Init Git repository
- Init NPM


### Dependencies:
- `shelljs`
